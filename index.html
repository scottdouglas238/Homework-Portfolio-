    I'm from Sand Diego California, but I prefer the Arizona heat. I'm not even being sarcastic about that one bit. I've worked in the restaurant business, the customer service industry, and have even tried my hand in construction. Key word: tried. Roofing was fun, but only becuase of the guys I worked with. Can you imagine the heat up there? We're talking about dealing with tar! My hobbies include getting hungry, driving to get food, and wanting to do it over again. As you can tell by my little image here, I love to play Rocket League. Rocket League is not a hobby. It is a way of life. For those who don't know what Rocket League is, it's a social media platform in which the users are at liberty to make as many jokes as possible. This is at least how I utilize the game. Most people (everyone except me) think of Rocket League as a video game. It's basically car soccer. It takes much skill and dedication to learn how to play properly, and the game is getting much more popular as time goes on.
