    My name is Scott Douglas. I have worked in many industries, including, but not limited to, food and beverage, customer service, banking, and retail. I am currently a student at The University of Arizona attending a coding bootcamp course, with the aim of becoming a professional programmer. I am a quick learner and am always eager for a challenge. During my time in customer service I learned how to deal with the public and have developed many professional relationships as a result. Attention too detail was crucial to my success when I worked for GM Financial, which is where I credit most of my professional experience. I was a service specialist. This role required me to speak to customers who requested a supervisor, sometimes taking close to 20 escalated calls in one day! Although it was not without challenges, I developed the skill of working under intense pressure.
